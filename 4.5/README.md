# Assignment 4.5

Write a program called issymlink that takes a filename as an argument and checks whether the filename is a symbolic link. If so, it should read the symbolic link file (and not the file pointed to by the symbolic link) and print its contents to stdout. Else it just prints a message saying passed filename is not a symbolic link.
